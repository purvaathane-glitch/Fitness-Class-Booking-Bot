🏋️ AI Fitness Innovative

AI Fitness Innovative is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts a user's fitness performance using input parameters such as workout hours, attendance, and previous records.

The project demonstrates the integration of Machine Learning with a Flask web application for real-time prediction.

🚀 Live Features

- User-friendly input form
- Real-time prediction output
- ML model integration with Flask
- Clean UI using HTML & CSS

📌 Problem Statement

Tracking fitness progress manually can be inaccurate and inconsistent. 
There is a need for an intelligent system that can analyze fitness-related inputs and provide predictive insights.

This project aims to solve this problem using Machine Learning.

🎯 Objectives

- Build a predictive Machine Learning model
- Develop a web-based interface using Flask
- Provide real-time fitness score prediction
- Demonstrate practical AI implementation

🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- HTML
- CSS
- Joblib
- Git & GitHub

🤖 Machine Learning Algorithm

- Decision Tree Regressor  
(or write your actual algorithm used)

The algorithm was selected because it handles structured numerical data efficiently and provides good prediction accuracy.

📊 Dataset

- Custom dataset created for fitness prediction
- Features include:
